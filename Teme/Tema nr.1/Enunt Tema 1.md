Write a Java program that accepts two integers from the user ( input from keyboard) and then prints the sum, the difference, the product, the average, the distance (the difference between integer), the maximum (the larger of the two integers), the minimum (smaller of the two integers).

**Test Data:**
Input 1st integer: 25
Input 2nd integer: 5

**Expected Output :**
Sum of two integers: 30
Difference of two integers: 20
Product of two integers: 125
Nr1/nr2 afisat cu decimale;
Average of two integers: 15.00
Distance of two integers: 20
Max integer: 25
